# Question

What is the most efficient way to implement multidimensional arrays in JavaScript?

**UPDATE**  Experiments for [numeric.js](http://www.numericjs.com/), [cwise](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/cwise) and [ndarray-ops](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/ndarray-ops) added

# Experiment
To run the experiment, just do:

    node experiment.js

# Results:

With:

* Core i7-3770k
* Windows 7 x64
* Node v0.10.5
* cwise 0.0.2
* ndarray 0.2.3
* ndarray-ops 0.1.3
* numeric 1.2.6

# Generic Observations

* Obviously 1D typed arrays are best performance
* Using `get([i,j,k])` for indexing is terrible.  `get(i,j,k)` is more than 10x faster.
* Similarly, it is pointless to store a separate offset field.  That can be handled using the the subarray() method from a typed array.
* Wrapped objects nearly match the performance of typed arrays, within a factor <2
* Arrays-of-arrays are 5-100x slower than objects, but have the advantage of interoperating with other libraries.
* Contiguous typed array allocation is strictly faster by a small margin (~5%), so if you are going down that route might as well do it.
* For arrays of arrays, it is a trade off by between typed arrays and native arrays.  Native arrays are faster if the last dimension is small, while typed arrays are faster if it is large.

## Reasonable Approaches to Arrays

Excluding obviously stupid things,

* Flat typed array, with manual index
    + Very fast
    + But also messy, requires repeating certain patterns everywhere
    + Does not carry semantic information like array shape
    + Higher dimensional `subarray` not supported, can only slice along first axis.

* Array-of-native arrays
    + Simple, JS/idiomatic access pattern
    + Complete representation of shape data
    + Compatible with numeric.js
    + Good for images or situations where last component is relatively small
    + Bad when last component list large
    + Need to convert to typed array when interfaced with WebGL
    + Hard to ensure validity.  (eg, checking all rows are actually rows)
    
* Array-of-typed-arrays
    + Same access pattern as array-of-arrays
    + Complete representation of shape data
    + Compatible with numeric.js
    + Good when last component is large (eg volume data)
    + Bad when last component is small
    + With contiguous allocation, can support direct WebGL uploads
    + Even harder to validate; need to check if array is contiguous and all types match

* Custom multidimensional array object
    + Near optimal performance
    + Semantically complete
    + Easy/simple validation
    + Can be directly uploaded to GPU
    + Awkward/non-standard interface, will require libraries standardize on convention
    
Based on performance considerations, I am currently leaning toward option 4, but dissenting opinions are welcome.


# **UPDATE** Observations about Libraries

* numeric.js is internally built using the array-of-native-arrays approach, and so it is naturally slower than using a typed array
* Also, the implementation of numeric_simple.js uses mul() which returns a copy (and so it is much slower)
* ndarray-ops uses cwise internally, and so it is generally speaking slower than cwise, but may still be useful for some simple operations (like array copying/assignment/basic pointwise operations)
* cwise uses macro expansion to inline functions and unroll loops, and reaches performance which is comparable to a native 1D typed array, with some small overhead due to unboxing primitives.
